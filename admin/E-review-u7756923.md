Component: GameInfo class

### Comments 

The function of the code is to decompose the game string into strings required by all other classes. I think the best features are its concise and clear structure. Meanwhile, the variable naming is complete and easy to understand, and follows the Java convention. One question is that he may not consider the "random number player" part, but directly stipulates the length of the player string to be 4, which may cause some problems.
