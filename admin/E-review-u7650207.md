Reviewing code written by: Andy Chih u7574003

Component: Marrakech.isRugValid() method.

### Comments 
#### Best Parts
* Code is effective and checks all required components of the rugString.
* All necessary logic operators and functions are used well to produce the correct output.
* There are no errors in the code which would cause it to function incorrectly.
#### Documentation
* The code has appropriate and effective commenting and variable names.
#### Class and Method Structure
* The method is fully self-contained, which is appropriate for the relative simplicity of the method's purpose and output.
#### Java Code Conventions
* Java code conventions are mostly followed.
* The use of multiple return statements should instead be replaced by a boolean tracker variable with a single return statement at the end of the method.
* The use of a break statement could be improved by using a While loop and increasing the counter to its maximum variable.
